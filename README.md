# The Artisanal Lens

A guided photography app for Indian handloom artisans, built in Flutter.

Handloom weavers struggle to sell online when product photographs do not show
what the cloth is actually like — texture, drape, weight, sheen. This app
closes that gap without asking the artisan to learn photography: it tells them
which photographs a listing needs, how to arrange the cloth, and then checks
light, angle and framing live through the camera before the shutter is pressed.

> Before you take the photo, The Artisanal Lens prepares the saree and shows
> you what a good photograph should look like.

Flutter app: [`artisanal_lens/`](artisanal_lens/). Package id:
`com.artisanallens.artisanal_lens`.

## Where it comes from

| Source | Supplies |
|---|---|
| Figma file *Artisans lens* | Colour, type, spacing, screen structure and copy. Nothing visual is invented. |
| BTP report — *Product Photography Guide for Handloom Artisans* (IIT Guwahati) | Eight photography guidelines, fabric-property mapping, five Saree photography templates, and findings from testing with artisans in the Kamrup cluster, Assam. |
| *Artisanal Lens* solution deck | Category-first flow and the fold / styling preset lists. |

Research shaped the product, not just the copy. Text instructions failed in
testing, so the UI is icon-led with one decision per screen. Artisans could not
judge lighting reliably, so the app measures it rather than describing it.

---

## Running it

```bash
cd artisanal_lens
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Requires Flutter with Dart SDK `^3.12.0`. Use a physical Android phone to judge
live capture guidance — it reads real camera frames and the accelerometer.

For the web build, fetch the sqlite WASM worker first (it is gitignored):

```bash
dart run sqflite_common_ffi_web:setup
flutter run -d chrome
```

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

**Use a release build to judge the opening animation.** Debug builds JIT-compile
Dart at startup, which buries that sequence behind a long splash:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The release APK is written to
`artisanal_lens/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

More device notes: [`artisanal_lens/RUNNING.md`](artisanal_lens/RUNNING.md).

### Supabase (cloud backup & sync)

**Pre-configured for this repo** — `flutter run` connects to the shared Supabase
project. Credentials live in `artisanal_lens/supabase.local.json` and
`lib/app/supabase_config.dart` (anon key only; safe for client apps).

```bash
cd artisanal_lens
flutter run
```

For release APKs, pass the same file so keys are baked into the build:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=supabase.local.json
```

On Windows: `.\run_app.ps1` also picks up `supabase.local.json`.

Open **Settings → Account & backup** to sign in and sync photos.

New collaborators: paste the prompt in
[`COLLABORATOR_CURSOR_PROMPT.md`](COLLABORATOR_CURSOR_PROMPT.md) into Cursor.

Full backend setup (migrations, tutorial uploads): [`supabase/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`](supabase/SUPABASE_SETUP.md).

## The flow

```
Opening sequence  (tap to skip)
  └─ Home  (New Product · Continue · Previous sets)
        │
        ├─ New Product
        │     Material (Silk, Cotton, Wool, Jute)
        │       └─ Fibre type
        │            Silk   → Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, Muga
        │            Cotton → Khadi, Muslin, Handloom, Jamdani
        │            Wool   → Pashmina, Angora, Merino, Handspun
        │            Jute   → Golden, Tossa, Hessian, Blended
        │              └─ Category (Saree, Cushion Cover, Shawl, Stole) + name
        │                   └─ Photo list  (five photography templates)
        │                        └─ How should it look?  (fold / style; skipped for close-ups)
        │                             └─ Lighting → Tutorial → Camera (live guidance)
        │                                  └─ Review (Use photo / Retake)
        │
        ├─ Previous sets  (All / Finished / Pending)
        └─ Gallery → Product viewer
```

Finished sets open the product viewer. Pending sets return to the photo list.
Empty slots in the viewer re-enter capture for that one photograph.

Each material and fibre type has its own thumbnail image in
`assets/images/materials/`, `silk_types/`, `cotton_types/`, `wool_types/`
and `jute_types/`.

### Photography templates — all four categories

Every category follows the Product Photography Guide with **five templates**
each, not the old seven-shot Figma checklist. List thumbnails live in
`assets/images/templates/`. **How should it look?** cards use one matching
product per category in the pose each fold needs.

| Category | Templates |
|---|---|
| **Saree** | Full Saree Display · Texture & Weave · Draped Look · Embroidery & Border · Folded Stack |
| **Cushion Cover** | Full Cover Display · Texture & Weave · Stacked Pair / Thickness · Corner & Stitching · In Use on Seating |
| **Shawl** | Full Design Display · Texture & Weave · Draped on Shoulder · Border & Corner · Folded Stack |
| **Stole** | Full Length Display · Texture & Weave · Neck Wrap · Edge Thickness · Softness Knot |

Close-up templates (texture, border, corner, and so on) skip **How should it
look?** — there is no fold to choose.

After a template is chosen, the app offers the four documented folds for that
category. Saree: Pallu drape, Box / flat fold, Worn drape, Roll display.
Cushion: Flat lay, Stacked pair, Propped, Corner tuck. Shawl and Stole have
their own four-fold lists in the same pattern.

## Live capture guidance

In `artisanal_lens/lib/domain/services/`. This is real image analysis, not a
scripted animation.

There is no setup slideshow and nothing to press through. The camera opens,
reads frames four times a second, and says one thing about the cloth actually
in front of the lens. What it says changes as the cloth or the phone moves.

**`FrameAnalyzer`** reads the luma (Y) plane of each YUV420 preview frame in a
single pass and measures: brightness and clipped highlights, texture, a coarse
map of where the product is (its bounding box, how much of the ghost frame it
fills, how much of the frame edge it runs over), fine-versus-coarse detail for
focus, and the dominant direction the fabric runs in.

**`FrameMetricsSmoother`** low-pass filters those readings so small hand
movements do not flicker the verdict.

**`CaptureGuidanceService`** turns those plus device pitch into one prompt, in
triage order: nothing in view → product outside the guide or off the edge →
too small or too large → fabric direction against the grid → light → blur →
angle and centring → ready. Only the top complaint is shown, and prompts name
the product ("Center the saree", "Place the cushion cover in view").

Each preset supplies its own profile: its ghost frame, how much of it to fill,
and whether its grid asks for a direction the analyser can measure. Only two
do — folds parallel to the horizontal guides, and fabric along the diagonals.
Fabric type, sheen, transparency, embroidery quality and whether a human
folded something correctly are not measurable here and are never claimed;
they are listed per preset in `CameraGuidanceProfile.undetectableConditions`.

**`LiveGuidanceStabiliser`** holds a message on screen until a new verdict
repeats, and makes "Ready to capture" earn an extra frame, so the pill does
not strobe. Guidance advises but never blocks — the shutter stays live
whatever it says. `camera_web` has no image stream, so this runs on Android
only; on the web the pill shows the preset's composition rule and never
claims the shot is ready.

## Architecture

Layered, dependencies pointing inward. `domain/` imports no Flutter and knows
nothing about storage.

```
artisanal_lens/lib/
├── app/                  MaterialApp, router, DI, locale, theme tokens
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/         ShotSet, ShotType, FoldPreset, PhotographyTemplate,
│   │                     FabricMaterial, CottonVariety, WoolVariety, JuteVariety, …
│   ├── repositories/     abstract interfaces

│   └── repositories/     implementations
├── features/<feature>/   presentation + its controller
└── shared/widgets/
```

**State** — Riverpod. `shotSetsProvider` is the source of truth for shoots.
`captureSessionProvider` carries choices across the one-decision-per-screen
flow.

**Navigation** — `go_router`. Tabs sit in a `ShellRoute`; capture runs above
the shell so the bottom bar is hidden mid-shoot.

**Storage** — sqflite, local only, offline-first. A shoot survives being closed
mid-set. Photographs are copied into app storage and, on Android, into the
device gallery album *The Artisanal Lens*.

**Languages** — Assamese, Hindi and English. Switch in Settings
(`lib/l10n/`).

## Adding a category

Categories and folds are data in
`artisanal_lens/lib/data/datasources/preset_catalog.dart`. Add a
`ProductCategory` and its `FoldPreset`s. `test/catalog_coverage_test.dart`
checks that every category × shot type can reach the camera.

Photography templates live in
`artisanal_lens/lib/domain/entities/photography_template.dart`.

---

## Known gaps

- **Tutorial videos.** The catalog references a `.mp4` per fold. Videos stream
  from Supabase Storage (`tutorial-videos` bucket) — they are not bundled in
  the APK. Upload each key via the Supabase Dashboard until all 15 are live;
  missing uploads show a placeholder in the app.
- **Step illustrations in the app bundle.** How-to cards for **Saree roll display**
  (5 steps) are bundled. Other folds still have source art in
  [`tutorial-videos-images/`](tutorial-videos-images/) that is not yet copied into `assets/images/steps/`.
- **Localisation polish.** Settings switches the UI between Assamese, Hindi
  and English. Catalog transcript lines and a few long setup sentences are
  still English; a native speaker should review the Assamese and Hindi copy.
